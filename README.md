# Rules
* Make sure to use arguments so the code doesn't need to be updated.
* Provide some guidance for the arguments.

**pdf2img.py**: convert a pdf document into individual png images.
<br />
**convert_images.py**: convert images in a folder to a new format via argument.
<br />
**exposure_bracketing.py**: merges a set of images into a HDR image using Debevec's method, applies tone mapping with the Drago algorithm.
<br />
**focus_bracketing.py**: loads and aligns a set of images to correct for any misalignment, and measures their focus using the Laplacian variance.
